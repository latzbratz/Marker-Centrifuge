# Marker-Centrifuge
### Don't throw away your markers!

## Instructions
  - Download and print the Marker-Centrifuge required files
  - Thread high strength string or twine through the two opposite holes 
      - length depends on user preference however to minimize the risk of becoming a projectile avoid making string too long
  - Tie knot securing the string together ~ 1 foot from the device (user preference)
  - Cut plastic bag to size to prevent marker from leaking and spraying everywhere (seriously dont be me)
  - Spin dead markers for roughly 30 second intervals
  - Check ink status
  - Repeat until success (or not)
  - Recycle any markers that no longer see success with this method
## WARNINGS
  - PLASTIC BAG/COVERING IS CRITICAL TO AVOID MESSES
  - _Be careful and try not to hit anyone or anything_ ...please
  - Dont be dumb.
